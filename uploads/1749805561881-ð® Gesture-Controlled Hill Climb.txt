🎮 Gesture Controlled Hill Climb Racing — A Simple Fun Project in My Free Time

I’ve seen so many cool posts lately — people controlling Temple Run, Subway Surfers, and other games using hand gestures with MediaPipe and OpenCV.

So I thought… why not build one for my all-time favorite — Hill Climb Racing?

In my free time, I decided to make a simple gesture control system to play the game — just using my webcam and hand gestures for ⛽ Gas and 🛑 Brake.
It was really exciting and satisfying working on this one!

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:

Python (3.11)

OpenCV – for real-time video feed

MediaPipe – for hand tracking

PyAutoGUI – to simulate keyboard input

BlueStacks Emulator – to run the game

Visual Studio Code – for development

OBS Studio – to record screen + audio

🧠 What I Built:

Tracked hand landmarks using MediaPipe

Detected simple gestures (like thumbs up/down)

Mapped them to game controls (Gas / Brake)

Synced gesture recognition with keypress actions

Tuned it for stability and recorded demo footage

🎯 This project gave me a hands-on understanding of:

Gesture recognition with minimal ML

Real-time video processing and key mapping

Emulator-based game control

Bringing automation into a fun context

This wasn’t a big or complex build — just a small project I enjoyed making during free hours to learn something cool and creative.

Built this just for fun — but the possibilities? Endless.
